    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to the “ToxBioDist (TBD) Analyzer”, a comprehensive analysis framework designed to support genomic medicine through the analysis and summarization of GLP/Non-GLP toxicity and biodistribution studies in immunosuppressed and non-immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys.\nThe primary goal of the “ToxBioDist (TBD) Analyzer” is to develop an integrative analysis workflow tailored to the unique challenges posed by data generated for genomic medicine. This workflow encompasses data structure standardization, quality checks, visualization of multi-dimensional data, identification of sources of variation, and quantification of exposure-response relationships, supporting posology assessments for pre-clinical to clinical program transitions.\nWith the recent acquisitions of genomic and cell therapy programs, Alexion CPSS has designed and implemented a framework and an ops model for innovating toxicology and pathology expertise, building a state-of-the-art Quantitative Systems Modeling platform, leveraging the Data Sciences Unit for conducting risk: benefit and posology assessments for pre-clinical to clinical program transitions. Unique approaches to data visualization and interpretation have been developed for biodistribution, expression of VGCs and mRNA, and toxicology study findings including histopathology. These approaches have been demonstrated in moving the pipeline forward and addressing relevant agency questions effectively.\nWe hope that the “ToxBioDist (TBD) Analyzer” will serve as a valuable resource for your endeavors in the field of genomic medicine and provide the necessary tools to navigate the complexities of multi-dimensional data analysis in pre-clinical and clinical program transitions.",

Group 2 utilizes the established control capsid, whereas Groups 3 and 4 employ the new JBC capsids developed by JCR Pharmaceuticals. Notably, the capsid used in Group 4, JBC-AAVdQ, is a liver-detargeting variant, which is anticipated to exhibit reduced liver distribution compared to the capsids used in Groups 2 and 3. Therefore, Groups 3 and 4 will be compared to Group 2 for CNS capsids.\nRegarding the DM1 capsids, Group 5 utilizes the established capsid, while Group 6 employs the new Gcap-106 capsid. Therefore, Group 6 (new) will be compared to Group 5 (old) for DM1 capsids.",

The objectives of this study are to determine the biodistribution and expression of AAV9 capsid variants, and potential toxicity after administration of a single dose intravenous bolus injection to cynomolgus monkeys.\nMore specifically, the objective of this study is to evaluate novel engineered AAV capsids that are believed to transduce the central nervous system or skeletal muscles with superior potency and selectivity compared to wild type AAVs. The transgenes used encode for wild type Glucocerebrosidase protein or a truncated version of muscle blind under control of neuronal promoter or skeletal muscle promoters, respectively. This would allow for robust expression in CNS or skeletal muscle tissues to assess selectivity of targeting.",

    "text": "Biodistribution and shedding studies are instrumental for developing adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies. These studies play a crucial role in understanding the distribution and persistence of the viral vector within the body, as well as its potential dissemination into the environment.\nThe main objectives of biodistribution studies are to investigate where and in what form the vector is present within various tissues and biological fluids, and to determine whether measurable amounts of the vector are shed into the environment. Typically, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based bioanalytical methods are employed to measure AAV vector DNA in tissues and biological fluids. These methods provide sensitive and specific quantification of the vector, enabling researchers to assess the biodistribution profile and shedding patterns of the AAV vector.\nIn this analysis, we present the visualization of biodistribution and shedding data through various techniques, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and heatmaps, to address the relevant questions.",
